<p>
  The Garden Path is a sandbox gardening game. Players will emerge into a
  long-forgotten garden, and unlock tools to help shape the garden into
  something they can call their own.
</p>
<p>
  Depending on how the player chooses to grow their garden will decide who
  chooses to live there from a pool of many possible vegetable-headed
  inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
  Time in the The Garden Path is tied to real-time, but with seasons passing
  each week, and years passing each month. With each season comes new events,
  weather, and collectables that can be brewed into teas, or traded with a cast
  of animal travellers.

<p>
  I've been an advocate for open source software since I can remember, so Godot
  just seemed like the right fit. It's a good feeling knowing that my work isn't
  under the thumb of any kind of restrictive licensing.
</p>
<p>
  I also liked the idea of being an early adopter at the time. There was buzz
  around the engine, but it still needs those flagship titles that people can
  point to. And that's really very important, because if people are asking 'how
  was this made' and the answer is something open source, that's a big
  accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
  Something for me to aspire toward, anyway.

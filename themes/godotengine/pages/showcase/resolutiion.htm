<p>
  An old killer escorts a curious AI through chaotic combat, puzzling secrets,
  and unsettling calm in a dreamscape of madmen and sane animals.
<p>
<p>
  Resolutiion is a fast-paced action-adventure created by two angry German
  brothers leading a band of vagrants who loaded it with lovely pixels, dirty
  jokes, deep ideas and badassemotional tunes for 20 hours of punishing combat,
  rewarding exploration, and layered storytelling. Will you be the player or
  will you be played? In the Infinite Empire nothing is as it seems.
</p>
<p>
  Explore a fractured future, gathering weird weapons and stories, to piece
  together the past: a friend betrayed, a family broken, worlds at war.
</p>
<p>
  To solve the mystery of the Cradles take on a multi-cultural-mashup of cynical
  gods, emotional machines, zealots, luddites, and furry critters in a world
  that doesn’t care if it confuses or kills you — oh hey, a kitty!

<p>
  Developing with Godot is very easy. The core functionality can be picked up
  quickly and the engine is powerful enough to accomplish everything we were
  looking for in our game. Also the community is awesome and creates plenty of
  valuable tutorials and guides.

    <strong>The Android editor is currently in an experimental
    stage. The UI has not been adapted for touch screens yet; using a hardware
    keyboard and mouse is strongly recommended.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to using the editor on desktop platforms, the experience may be frustrating,
    especially if you do not use a hardware keyboard and mouse. See the list of
    <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aplatform%3Aandroid+label%3Atopic%3Aeditor+">known
    issues affecting the Android editor</a> for more information.
